      Add CSS as you like linked or otherwise, but encapsulate most within the card components.  

      You should also include the script code separately.  You may wish to have individual files 
      for the customElement vs the page layout and CRUD actions if you do them. Regardless of 
      what you do you use ES modules and vanilla JS.

      This page will contain a list of cards which will contain cards that overview each project in 
      your portfolio. You will dynamically create these cards as CustomElements using JavaScript 
      and populate them from localStorage and from a JSON file fetched remotely from a server using 
      Ajax or fetch.

      You should create a CustomElement called <project-card> which will contain at least the 
      following elements:

        - <h2>Project Name</h2>
        - <img src="image.jpg" alt="Project Image">
        - <p>Project Description</p>
        - <a href="URL">Read More</a>

      You can have more things if you like such as date, keywords or tags, author, etc.

      Make two buttons "Load Local" and "Load Remote" in both cases you will fetch and array of JSON 
      data to populate your cards. The difference is that the "Load Local" button will fetch from 
      localStorage and the "Load Remote" button will fetch from a remote server. 

      - You should use CSS variables to style your cards.
      - You should use CSS grid or flexbox to layout your cards.
      - You should use the CustomElements API to create your custom elements.
      - You should use either JSONBin API or My JSON Server to store your data in the cloud.
      - You should use the localStorage API to store your data locally.
      - You should use the fetch or XMLHttpRequest API to fetch data from a server.
      
      - You can use any random data you like and images you like for the cards, but eventually you 
      may want to change it.
      - You can use the Unsplash API to get random images for your cards. 
      - You can use the JSONPlaceholder API to get random data for your cards. 
      - You can use the DOM API to add your custom elements to the DOM. 

      You should be able to do this for some canned set of data you store in localStorage 
      and the cloud.

      For extra credit (10%) you can create a second page crud.html which has a form that allows you 
      to perform CRUD actions (create, add, update, delete) on the data in either the localStorage or 
      cloud based storage. You may roll this code yourself or use something like ZingGrid or any 
      other simple custom element you can find for your fake backend.

      In all cases except the following section you may not use any libraries or frameworks. You 
      must use the native APIs and vanilla JavaScript. This includes Lit and jQuery as well as any 
      other library or framework.

      Advanced students with existing framework knowledge may wish to perform this activity again 
      with a framework or library of their choice for further extra credit. If you do this, you 
      must still do the vanilla JavaScript version first and then do the framework version as 
      further extra credit (5% more). You must however do the first extra credit before you attempt 
      the second.  We will not accept second extra credits without the first. The second extra credit 
      requires a README.md with an analysis of the performance and lines of code impact of using the 
      framework or library. If you perform the 2nd extra credit you must be cautious to provide a 
      fully working example that does not require complex set-up for the grader. You should either 
      use a local file, CDN or other simple method to load the framework or library. You should not 
      require the grader to install anything or run any build scripts.
